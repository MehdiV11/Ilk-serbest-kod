            The cat (Felis catus), also called domestic cat and house cat, is a
            small carnivorous mammal. It is an obligate carnivore, requiring a
            predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable claws are adapted to
            killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong,
            flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision
            and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
            solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication
            includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting,
            and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
            frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It
            secretes and perceives pheromones. Cat intelligence is evident in
            its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems.
            Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
            temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
            litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. The domestic
            cat is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances
            in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the
            cat started in the Near East around 7500 BCE. Today, the domestic
            cat occurs across the globe and is valued by humans for
            companionship and its ability to kill vermin. It is commonly kept as
            a pet, working cat, and pedigreed cat shown at cat fancy events. Out
            of the estimated 600 million domestic cats worldwide, 400 million
            reside in Asia, including 58 million in China. The United States
            leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats, followed by the
            United Kingdom with approximately 10.9 million cats. It also ranges
            freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. Pet abandonment
            contributes to increasing of the global feral cat population, which
            has driven the decline of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
            Population control includes spaying and neutering. Etymology and
            naming The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is
            thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at
            the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be
            derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word
            kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or
            cognates.[6] The forms might also have derived from an ancient
            Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek,
            Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and
            Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic,
            cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy 'lady,
            female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä 'female (of a furred
            animal)'.[8] The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is
            attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from
            Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish
            kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in
            Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology is
            unknown, but it may be an onomatopoeia from using a sound to attract
            a cat.[9][10] A male cat is called a tom, tommy or tomcat[11] (or a
            gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen (or sometimes a
            molly,[13] if spayed).[14] Some sources write that queen refers
            solely to unspayed cats that are in an estrous cycle.[15] A juvenile
            cat is referred to as a kitten (shortened to kitty in British
            English[16]), a term interchangeable with the now-obsolete word
            catling in Early Modern English.[17] A group of cats can be referred
            to as a clowder, a glaring,[18] or a colony.[19] Taxonomy The
            scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758
            for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by
            Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon proposed
            by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the
            Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[20][21] In 2003,
            the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature conserved
            the name silvestris Erxleben 1777 for the wildcat, but did not
            suppress catus Linnaeus 1758.[22][23] In 2007, the modern
            domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus was sampled worldwide
            and considered to have probably descended from the African wildcat
            (F. lybica), following results of phylogenetic research.[24][25][a]
            In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce, following the
            recommendation of Gentry et al. (2004)[23] that names based on
            domestic forms be used for domestic derivatives of wild species,
            regarded the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.[26]

              The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that has a
              common ancestor from about 10 to 15 million years ago.[27] The
              evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the
              Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.[28] Analysis of
              mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at
              6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[29] The genus Felis genetically
              diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.[28]
              Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of
              this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation,
              whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[30]
              The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and
              both possess 38 chromosomes[31] and roughly 20,000 genes.[32]

          <p>
            It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in
            ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100
            BCE.[34][35] However, the earliest known indication for the taming
            of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave
            in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BCE.
            Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the
            inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat
            and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern
            mainland.[36] Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were
            attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by
            rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were
            tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early
            farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural
            practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[33][37]
            Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the
            domestic cat at a later time.[38] The earliest known evidence for
            the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200
            BCE. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced
            it to southern Europe.[39] By the 5th century BCE, it was a familiar
            animal around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.[40] During
            the Roman Empire, it was introduced to Corsica and Sardinia.[41] By
            the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian
            domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern
            Germany.[38] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed
            independently in China around 5500 BCE. This line of a partially
            domesticated cat left no trace in the domestic cat populations of
            today.[42] During domestication, cats have undergone only minor
            changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of
            surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics
            of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets.
            These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body
            language, love of play, and high intelligence. Their rigorous
            grooming habits and instinct to bury their bodily waste make them
            generally much less messy than other domesticated animals. Captive
            Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans
            but are not domesticated.[43] House cats may mate with feral
            cats.[44] The development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th
            century.[45] An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that
            the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the
            process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to
            develop cat breeds.[46] Most breeds are founded on random-bred
            domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between
            regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than
            20 deleterious genetic disorders.[47] Hybridization between domestic
            and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such
            as the Kellas cat in Scotland.[48][49]
