            The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
            domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic
            dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the
            Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs were the first species to
            be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of
            agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
            gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
            inadequate for other canids. Dogs have been bred for desired
            behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds
            vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of
            bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
            around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and
            sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell
            and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for
            humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
            companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police
            and the military. Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial
            expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of
            bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones,
            and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which
            is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia,
            dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation
            includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As
            such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and
            dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
            "man's best friend". The global dog population is estimated at 700
            million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the
            most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of
            households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the
            global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be
            from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and street
            dogs.

            Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest
            breeds, the Great Dane, at 50–79 kg (110–174 lb) and 71–81 cm (28–32
            in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5–3 kg (1.1–6.6 lb)
            and 13–20 cm (5.1–7.9 in).[31][32] All healthy dogs, regardless of
            their size and type, have the same number of bones (with the
            exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal
            variation between dogs of different types.[33][34] The dog's
            skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and
            back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles
            and hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for
            the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the
            skeleton, allowing for flexibility.[33][34][35] Compared to the
            dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication
            has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such
            as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers;
            dwarfism has been selectively bred for some types where short legs
            are preferred, such as dachshunds and corgis.[34] Most dogs
            naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally
            short tails have as few as three.[33]

            Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and
            magnetoreception. One study suggests that dogs can feel small
            variations in Earth's magnetic field.[38] Dogs prefer to defecate
            with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm magnetic
            field conditions.[39] Dogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual
            world consists of yellows, blues, and grays.[40] They have
            difficulty differentiating between red and green,[41] and much like
            other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells
            compared to the human's three. The divergence of the eye axis of
            dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have
            different retina configurations.[42][43] The fovea centralis area of
            the eye is attached to a nerve fiber, and is the most sensitive to
            photons.[44] Additionally, a study found that dogs' visual acuity
            was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability
            to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than
            a human.[45] While the human brain is dominated by a large visual
            cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex. Dogs
            have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans,
            ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog
            breeds, such as bloodhounds.[46] This sense of smell is the most
            prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the
            environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating
            partners, potential stressors, resources, etc.[47] Dogs also have an
            acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans.
            They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft)
            compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.[48] Dogs have stiff, deeply
            embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes,
            vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions. The
            lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair
            types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide
            with the nose, ears, and jaw. Whiskers likely also facilitate the
            movement of food towards the mouth.[49]
